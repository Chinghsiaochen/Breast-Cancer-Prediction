## Business Goal
Breast cancer stands as the predominant form of cancer affecting women globally. The genesis of breast cancer lies in the uncontrolled proliferation of cells within the breast tissue, culminating in discernible tumors detectable through diagnostic methods such as X-rays or palpable lumps. To address this task, the endeavor is to utilize machine learning techniques to leverage predictive analysis on Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

## Data Description

The dataset is taken from UCI Machine Learning Database. 
There are 569 instances, each instance has 32 attributes (ID, diagnosis, 30 real-valued input features).
The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features: 

	a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
	b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
	c) perimeter
	d) area
	e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
	f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
	g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
	h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
	i) symmetry 
	j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
